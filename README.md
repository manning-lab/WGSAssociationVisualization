# WGSAssociationVisualization

## Regional plots from WGS summary statistics
Maintainer: Manning Lab <br>
Version: 0.1

## Description
This application is designed to produce regional plots of a given search range from a bgzipped WGS summary statistics file stored in your Google bucket. The regional plots thus produced can be downloaded as PNG files.

### Data required to run this application
 - WGS summary statistics file in bgzipped (.gz) format residing in a Google bucket to which you have access. <br>
 The file should contain at least the following columns:
   - MarkerName: unique variant identifier (ex: rsID or chr_pos_ref_alt)
   - chr: chromosome
   - pos: variant position
   - pvalue: p-value
   <br>
 - A tabix indexed file in (.gz.tbi) format in the same location.
 
### Output generated by this application
 - Regional plots in PNG format.

### Prerequisites - 
* [Tabix](http://www.htslib.org/doc/tabix.html)
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

 ```
 - Build the manninglab/visualization_app image <br> 
 ```
   docker build -t manninglab/visualization_app . 
 ```
 - Run the image manninglab/visualization_app in a docker container called visualization_app <br> 
 ```
   docker run --rm --name visualization_app -ti -p 3838:80 manninglab/visualization_app /bin/bash 
 ```
 
 #### Running a demo session
 - You are now in the docker container. To execute the demo: <br>
 ```
   ./demo_script.sh 
 ```
 
 Navigate to your web browser -

 Give the plot a minute to generate. <br>
 
 - Optionally, change the range you want to search in. 
 - Click Submit to view the plot
 - Clicking the Download button will download the plot as a .png file (for eg. Regional_plot_20:60900000-61100000.png) 
 
 #### Exiting the demo session
Navigate back to your terminal - 
 - Type Ctrl+C on Windows or Command+C on Mac <br>
 
 If you wish to run the app using your data in the Google bucket, follow the next steps. <br>
 
 If not, to exit the docker session:
 ```
   exit
